# Cloud-Security-Policies-for-Saas

This project is to design the security architecture framework for a fictitious company called Healthfirst. Healthfirst is a small healthcare provider. As such, the company is bound by several agencies and entities to provide secure services. This project will create the security policy framework to deliver secure services via a hybrid cloud, regardless of the cloud vendor utilized.

Bruce Schneier famously said, “Security is a process, not a product.” (Schneier, 2000). As soon as this paper is complete, more policies can be written. More processes can be developed. There is no way to make all the policies needed for an organization. Policies are ever evolving to suit the organization. If they stay stagnant, so to will the organization.  
1.	Business description and benefits examined
0.	As a startup, there are no current policies in place. This project will create the framework that internal and external entities will need to adhere to as they develop internal and external applications. This will be outlined in each of the sections in the TOC. 

As a result of this framework, Healthfirst will be able to deliver secure services and comply with the prevailing legal entities. This will include, but not be limited to HIPAA, SOC, PCI, HITECH, NIST, and ISO.
